## Description
A social media app featuring the ability to post text and images, and comment on user posts

## Instructions
Sign into the website with your Google account, and post a message and photo - think of it like a virtual social group where you can share your interests and recent life moments. If you're not happy with your post, you can delete it. Whatever you post, I'll be sure to leave a comment.

## About
I developed ReactSocial as a custom social media platform to interact with friends and family by sharing images and posting about various topics for fun. The application is built using React for the frontend, with Firebase handling the backend, including authentication, Firestore for the database, and hosting. Material-UI is used extensively to ensure a modern and accessible UI/UX.

### Process
Building ReactSocial involved several major steps. Initially, I set up the React frontend and integrated Firebase for authentication and database management. Upgrading Firebase required significant refactoring to align with the new APIs and features. Integrating Material-UI was another key step, which involved reworking the styling approach to leverage its theming and component library effectively. Additionally, ensuring seamless and secure user interactions required troubleshooting complex user state and authentication flows.

### Built With
* React
* Firebase
* React-Router
* Material-Ui
